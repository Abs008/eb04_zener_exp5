## About the Lab (objective):-
1.	To give student a feel for the real world system and how to use theoretical Knowledge on Practical system.
2.	From this Virtual lab students will able to perform simulation of Zener Diode and calculate its forward and reverse resistance .
3.	Student will learn how to analyze and simulate the performance of Realistic Model.

## About the Experiment:-

In this experiment we are implementing the V-I characteristic of Zener Diode and calculating its forward and reverse resistance by graphical method.
A zener diode conducts excellently even in reverse biased condition. These diodes operate at a precise value of voltage called break down voltage.
   A zener diode when reverse biased can either undergo avalanche break down or zener break down.

##### a)	Avalanche breakdown :- 
If both p-side and n-side of the diode are lightly doped, depletion region at the junction widens.
Application of a very large electric field at the junction may rupture covalent bonding between electrons. 
Such rupture leads to the generation of a large number of charge carriers resulting in avalanche multiplication.


##### b)	Zener breakdown :-
If both p-side and n-side of the diode are heavily doped, depletion region at the junction reduces. Application of even a small voltage at the junction 
ruptures covalent bonding and generates large number of charge carriers. Such sudden increase in the number of charge carriers results in zener mechanism.


Hence, The table obtained by connecting zener diode in  forward and reverse bias gives the value of Cut in and Break down voltage.
i.e.

1. Cut in voltage = ……… V
2. Break down voltage = ……… V
